Install dependencies for vs code

Next, install the package dependencies for this project, making sure to use the provided version numbers below. Make sure you are in the nucampsite folder in your terminal.
You will see some warnings and notices. You can safely ignore these. If you see any messages explicitly marked "ERR" or "Error", try to debug the error (was there a typo?) and ask in the course Slack channel if you cannot resolve it.
npm install lite-server --save-dev
npm install jquery@3.5.1 popper.js@1.16.1
npm install bootstrap@4.5.2
The --save-dev flag means that lite-server is being installed as a development dependency, which means that later, when you build your project for deployment, it will not be included in the final build files, since it is only needed during development. 
You'll notice that a "package-lock.json" file  was automatically created after installing packages. This is expected and should be left alone.
